# Roact Tutorial Examples

This repository holds all of the examples used in the Roact tutorial by Roblox Developer Academy:

The Roact module used in this project is located in src/ReplicatedStorage to allow the examples to function properly. Don't pull the module from there for your own projects - get it directly from the [Roact repository](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/releases)!

The examples are located under src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts. Each folder is named after its corresponding video chapter. If you're running these examples, it's best to only do one at a time so they don't overlap.

This repository can be directly synced into Studio with Rojo. If you don't use Rojo, you can also download and open the Examples.rbxl file as an alternative.
