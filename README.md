# Roact Tutorial Examples

This repository holds all of the examples used in the Roact tutorial by Roblox Developer Academy:

The Roact module used in this project is located in src/ReplicatedStorage to allow the examples to function properly. Don't pull the module from there for your own projects - get it directly from the [Roact repository](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/releases)!

The examples are located under src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts. Each folder is named after its corresponding video chapter. If you're running these examples, it's best to only do one at a time so they don't overlap.
